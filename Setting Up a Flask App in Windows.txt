1. Install Python
2. Create a directory for the flask project.

7. From command line, "Python Hello.py" to run your Flask project.

		app.run(host, port, debug, options)
		
		host: Hostname to listen on. Defaults to 127.0.0.1 (localhost). Set to ‘0.0.0.0’ to have server available externally
		port: Defaults to 5000
